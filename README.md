Open source high temperature 3D printer

Had this idea for a while to create a real high temp printer and make it fully open source to speedup the adoption of the technology.
I will upload work in progress drawings here, but since Fusion 360 is now in full rentware mode, I am not yet sure about the file format.

Design goals:
Build area/volume: 450x450x400mm
Chamber temp: 180,
Fully insulated,
Most standard components,
At least 2 nozzles.
